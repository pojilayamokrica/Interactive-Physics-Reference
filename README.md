## About project
**The project is a user-friendly and easy-to-use interactive physics reference book for schoolchildren and students.**

### My program can be used:
+ For students and schoolchildren to repeat and memorize formulas in physics
+ Accounts that can use the product as an additional material

## –ùow to use?
When you start the program, on the main project window, you will see buttons with the names of physics sections subscribed to them. In some sections, there are subsections that represent a list of the buttons of this section that you clicked on in the main window. When you click on the section buttons of the main window or the subsection buttons, you will see a small picture with a list of formulas and a small explanation to them. Also, the project implements an easy search option that can tell you which section contains the subsection you need. The query can contain several names, then all sections with and without subsections will be found.
